- text: Eyowo is a nice application that I use for all sorts of transactions. I would rather use the app than the USSD code. What I enjoy most about Eyowo is how simple it works. I use it to send money to my colleagues at work and my relatives.

- text: Eyowo is a nice product that I enjoy because it is fast and easy to use. I use both *4255# and the Eyowo user app. When I need to pay my sales personnel, I just log on to the Eyowo Web app and the process is so seamless.
